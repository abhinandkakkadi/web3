Hashing - 
Converting a string to a fixed size of string with random characters.

Properties:
Deterministic - Given the same input text and hash function, the output should always be the same
Fast Computation - Self Explanatory
Pre-Image Resistance - Should not allow us to convert it back to it's original form.
Small changes in input should produce drastically change the hash output.
Collision Resistance - two different input should not have the same output.
